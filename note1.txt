Shell: textual interface
~: home directory
$: not the root user

shell consults environment variable $PATH -> list directories to search for the relevant programs (separated by :)
e.g. which echo
can bypass PATH by giving the path to the file we want to execute
e.g. /usr/bin/echo

Linux: / is the root of the file system
Paths start with / are absolute paths 
Relative paths are relative to current directory:
. current directory
.. parent directory 

ls -l: drwxr-xr-x: d for directory, rwx for file's owner permission; r-x for owning group; r-x for the rest
mv: move; cp: copy;
man -command: get the manual page

2 streams: input and output
echo hello > hello.txt: write the output of echo hello to hello.txt
cat < hello.txt > hello2.txt: get the input from hello.txt and write to hello2.txt 

>> append; echo hello2 >> hello.txt
| chain programs
curl --head --silent google.com | grep --ignore-case content-length | cut --delimiter=' ' -f2
grep: search;

tee hello.txt -> record everything you type into hello.txt
find: find file/directory

sudo find -L /sys/class/backlight -maxdepth 2 -name '*brightness*'
cd /sys/class/backlight/thinkpad_screen
echo 3 | sudo tee brightness

chmod u=rwx,g=wx,o=r filename

stat ex1.sh | grep --ignore-case modify | cut --delimiter=":" -f2- | xargs > last-modified.txt

cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp
cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_now
